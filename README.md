🧩 Problem Statement

Deforestation is increasing rapidly, and manual monitoring of vast forest areas is inefficient and time-consuming. There is a need for an automated system that detects forest loss quickly and accurately using satellite images.

💡 Solution

A CNN-based deep learning model is developed to classify satellite images into forested and deforested categories. The system analyzes patterns, identifies deforestation signs, and provides fast predictions to support monitoring and conservation.
